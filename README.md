# ft_libft

## Overview
`ft_libft` is a project that forms the foundation of the **42** curriculum, focusing on reimplementing key functions from the C standard library. This library provides a custom version of standard C functions and additional utility functions to facilitate development in future projects.

## Features
The library includes:

1. **Recreated Standard Library Functions**  
   Basic functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`, and others, closely following the standard library's behaviors.

2. **Memory Management Functions**  
   Functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, and others to handle raw memory operations.

3. **String Manipulation Functions**  
   Various tools for string handling, such as `ft_strchr`, `ft_strstr`, `ft_strncmp`, and more.

4. **Utility Functions**  
   Custom implementations of useful utility functions, like `ft_atoi` and `ft_isdigit`.

5. **Additional Bonus Functions**  
   Functions like `ft_lstadd`, `ft_lstdel`, and others for list manipulations, designed to help with more complex data structures in future projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To compile and use `ft_libft`, you need:
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS).
- `make` and `gcc` (or another C compiler) installed.

### Compilation
To compile the library, clone the repository and run:

```bash
make
```

This will produce a `libft.a` static library file, which you can link to your own projects.

### Usage
To use `ft_libft` in your project, include the header file in your source files:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Then, link the compiled library when compiling your project:

```bash
gcc your_file.c -L. -lft -o your_program
```

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Source files for the implemented functions.
- **includes/**: Header files defining prototypes and macros.
- **Makefile**: For easy compilation and cleaning.

## Goals
- Reimplement essential C library functions to gain a deeper understanding of low-level programming.
- Improve proficiency with C language syntax, memory handling, and data structures.
- Build a solid library foundation for future projects at **42**.
